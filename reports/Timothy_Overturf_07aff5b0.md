## 1. Executive Summary
Timothy Overturf is the founder and CEO of Sisu Capital, LLC, a now-defunct investment advisory firm formerly based in Mill Valley, California. The subject is currently facing critical regulatory and legal risks following a 2023 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint alleging widespread fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and unauthorized trading. The most significant finding involves a multi-year scheme (2017–2021) where Overturf and his father, Hansueli Overturf, allegedly ignored client instructions to invest in a thinly-traded bank stock to further their own personal business interests.

The investigation reveals a high-risk profile characterized by severe regulatory enforcement actions and operational instability. Overturf is accused of allowing his father to provide investment advice while suspended by the State of California and failing to disclose this disciplinary history to clients. While Overturf has diversified into other business ventures, such as the Arcata Theatre Lounge, his professional standing in the financial sector is severely compromised by the SEC’s pursuit of permanent injunctions and significant financial penalties.

## 6. Source Assessment
- **Primary sources:** SEC Litigation Releases, Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) records, FINRA records, and legal news outlets (MDF Law, Sonn Law).
- **Information gaps:** Current status of the Arcata Theatre Lounge's profitability; specific details on the "secret plan" bank's identity; final judgment details of the SEC case if settled post-2024.
- **Limitations:** Research is based on public filings and allegations; until a final court judgment is rendered, charges remain "allegations."

## 7. Recommendations
1. Monitor the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California for the final judgment or settlement terms in *SEC v. Sisu Capital, LLC, et al.*
2. Conduct a background check on the Arcata Theatre Lounge to ensure no commingling of funds from Sisu Capital occurred during the acquisition.
3. Verify the current status of Timothy Overturf’s Series 65 license, as the SEC may seek a permanent bar from the securities industry.
