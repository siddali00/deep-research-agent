# Comprehensive Risk Assessment Report  
**Subject:** Timothy Overturf (CEO, Sisu Capital)  
**Date:** 2025-11-15  
**Prepared by:** [Redacted]

## 1. Executive Summary

This report assesses the risks associated with Timothy Overturf, identified as the CEO and founder of Sisu Capital, LLC, and co-owner of the Arcata Theatre Lounge. The subject is implicated in significant legal, financial, and reputational risks, primarily due to an active SEC fraud complaint and related regulatory actions. Critically, there is a fundamental identity inconsistency: evidence points to at least two distinct individuals named Timothy Overturf—one a retired Navy Captain/Realtor (1954–2025), another a California-based investment advisor and theatre owner. This ambiguity creates severe operational and due diligence risks and must be resolved before any further action.

**Most Critical Findings:**
- **SEC fraud complaint** against Timothy Overturf and Sisu Capital (high confidence, high severity).
- **Identity contradiction**: Two individuals with overlapping but distinct professional and biographical records (very high severity).
- **Network risk**: Familial involvement (father Hansueli Overturf) in alleged misconduct.
- **Labor law violations** at Arcata Theatre Lounge.
- **Sisu Capital is defunct**; significant client asset mismanagement alleged.

**Action Required:**  
Immediate clarification of subject identity is mandatory. All risk assessments and due diligence actions should be suspended until the identity issue is resolved.
