## 1. Executive Summary

Timothy Overturf, former CEO of Sisu Capital, LLC, is the subject of a critical, ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) civil action (Case No. 3:23-cv-03855, N.D. Cal.) alleging significant violations of federal securities laws, including fraud, unauthorized trading, and breach of fiduciary duty. The complaint also names his father, Hansueli Overturf, and details a pattern of misconduct from 2017–2021, resulting in over $2 million in client funds withdrawn under questionable circumstances. Sisu Capital was shut down in 2021 following regulatory scrutiny and loss of registration. Overturf remains active in local business, notably as CEO of Arcata Theatre Lounge.  
**Risk exposure is assessed as critical across legal, financial, operational, and reputational domains.**
