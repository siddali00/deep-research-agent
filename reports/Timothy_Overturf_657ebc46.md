## 1. Executive Summary

Timothy Overturf, founder and former CEO of Sisu Capital, a now-defunct wealth management firm based in Mill Valley, California, is currently the subject of significant regulatory and legal scrutiny.

These actions have resulted in critical legal, financial, operational, and reputational risks. The closure of Sisu Capital coincided with the emergence of these regulatory actions, raising further concerns about the handling of client assets and the integrity of business practices.  
**Critical Finding:** Overturf faces ongoing SEC litigation with potential for severe civil penalties, permanent injunctions, and reputational harm.
