## 1. Executive Summary
Timothy Overturf is the founder and CEO of Sisu Capital, LLC, a California-based investment advisory firm. The subject is currently the primary focus of a critical regulatory enforcement action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Filed in August 2023, the SEC complaint alleges that Overturf and Sisu Capital breached their fiduciary duties by conducting unauthorized and unsuitable trades, failing to disclose material conflicts of interest, and allowing a suspended individual to provide investment advice to clients.

The most critical findings involve Overturf’s professional conduct between 2017 and 2021, during which he allegedly permitted his father, Hansueli Overturf—who was suspended from the industry by the State of California—to manage client accounts. This arrangement reportedly generated over $2 million in fees for Sisu Capital, while Overturf himself personally drew approximately $858,000 from the firm during a portion of this period. The ongoing federal litigation (Case #: 3:23-cv-03855) poses severe legal, financial, and reputational risks to the subject and any associated entities.
