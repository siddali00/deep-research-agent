### 1. Executive Summary
Timothy Overturf is the founder and CEO of Sisu Capital, LLC, currently facing severe regulatory enforcement action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The primary risk stems from a 2023 federal complaint alleging a multi-year scheme involving breaches of fiduciary duty, fraud, and the unauthorized use of a suspended advisor (his father, Hansueli Overturf) to manage client funds. With over $2 million in questionable fees generated and significant personal draws taken during the period of alleged misconduct, Overturf presents a **Critical** risk profile for financial, legal, and reputational exposure.

### 3. Key Findings

#### **Regulatory & Legal Violations**
*   **SEC Enforcement:** On August 1, 2023, the SEC charged Overturf and Sisu Capital with violating the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Allegations include unauthorized trading and investing client funds in "thinly-traded bank stocks" and unsuitable complex instruments for personal gain.
*   **Aiding and Abetting:** Overturf allegedly permitted his father, Hansueli "Hans" Overturf, to provide investment advice and execute trades despite Hans being suspended by the State of California from such activities.

#### **Financial Irregularities**
*   **Revenue & Draws:** Between 2017 and 2021, Sisu Capital generated ~$2 million in advisory fees. During a similar period (2017–2019), Timothy Overturf reportedly took $858,000 in personal owner draws and loans.
*   **Asset Management:** At its peak, the firm managed ~$51.7 million for 42 high-net-worth clients.

#### **Business Diversification**
*   **Arcata Theatre Lounge:** In 2019, while the alleged financial misconduct was occurring, Overturf acquired the Arcata Theatre Lounge via Joseppi’s LLC with partner Joseph Ostini. This represents a significant shift of capital from financial services to hospitality/entertainment.

### 4. Risk Assessment

| Category | Severity | Assessment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legal** | **CRITICAL** | Ongoing SEC litigation in San Francisco federal court. Potential for permanent injunctions and heavy civil penalties. |
| **Financial** | **HIGH** | Allegations of self-dealing and "contrary trading" suggest a high risk of asset dissipation. $2M in fees are subject to disgorgement. |
| **Operational** | **HIGH** | Demonstrated failure of internal controls by allowing a suspended individual (Hans Overturf) to manage client accounts. |
| **Reputational** | **HIGH** | Significant negative press in local (Lost Coast Outpost) and financial media. Association with "fraud" and "fiduciary breach" is well-documented. |

### 5. Connection Map

*   **Hansueli "Hans" Overturf (Father):** **Central Risk Factor.** Provided the initial client base; acted as a shadow advisor while suspended; co-defendant in SEC litigation.
*   **Joseph Ostini (Business Partner):** Co-owner of Joseppi’s LLC. While not named in SEC filings, the partnership links the theatre's assets to Overturf’s financial profile.
*   **Sisu Capital, LLC:** The primary vehicle for the alleged misconduct; currently inactive but remains the focus of the SEC’s disgorgement efforts.

---

### 6. Source Assessment
*   **Confidence Level:** **High (0.85)** for legal and professional facts based on SEC Litigation Release No. 25807 and official Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) records.
*   **Information Gaps:** Current status of "service of process" (reports suggest Overturf may have been difficult to locate for legal service as of late 2023). Current status of Captains Fund LLC operations is unclear.

---

### 7. Recommendations
1.  **Litigation Tracking:** Monitor Case No. 3:23-cv-03855 (N.D. Cal.) for updates on service, motions for default judgment, or settlement agreements.
2.  **Asset Tracing:** Investigate if client funds from Sisu Capital were commingled with or used to fund the acquisition of the Arcata Theatre Lounge or Joseppi’s LLC.
3.  **Due Diligence:** Any entity considering business with Joseppi’s LLC or Arcata Theatre Lounge should be aware that Overturf’s ownership stake may be subject to future SEC disgorgement orders or liens.
