## 1. Executive Summary
Timothy Overturf is the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Sisu Capital, LLC, a California-based investment advisory firm. Research indicates that Overturf and his firm are currently facing critical legal and regulatory challenges. In August 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Overturf with multiple violations of the Investment Advisers Act, including breaches of fiduciary duty and the facilitation of unauthorized trading by a suspended individual.

The most significant risk identified is the allegation that Overturf allowed his father, Hansueli Overturf—who was suspended from providing investment advice by the State of California—to manage client accounts and execute trades without disclosure to clients. Furthermore, the SEC alleges that Overturf engaged in unsuitable trading in thinly-traded securities to benefit his own interests. Financial records suggest Overturf withdrew over $850,000 in owner draws and loans while the firm collected millions in fees from these disputed investment activities. Given the firm's closure in 2021 and the ongoing litigation, Overturf presents a critical reputational and legal risk profile.
